# Snake-GameProject
In this repository you will find a copy of the Snake project that I developed in collaboration with Steven Lopez (steven.lopez11@upr.edu) as part of the final evaluation of the Advanced Programming course (CIIC4010) in 2023. Our goal was to complete the Snake game using the object-oriented language C++ and the openFrameworks platform.
